# Write specific contracts

:::caution DRAFT

While ContractCase is in beta, some of the documentation is incomplete or bullet points only.

Each breaking change during the beta, one more document will be completed. If this notice is present in a document, it is not yet considered complete. If you are having trouble using ContractCase or you would like a particular document prioritised, please [open an issue](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/case/issues/new)
:::

Because a contract is by example, ContractCase doesn't support writing contracts with optional fields. This document will explain why.

# Documentation has moved

Now at [https://case.contract-testing.io](https://case.contract-testing.io).

Loose maintainer documentation is in the folder [here](./maintainers/)

Note that the changelog in the maintainers folder collates all changes from all
packages, and doesn't represent any real releases. It's a tool for maintainers
to see what was released together.
